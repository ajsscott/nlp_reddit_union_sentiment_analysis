# Union Sentiment Analysis on Reddit — NLP and Big Data

This repository presents my project for Machine Learning and Big Data class, which analyzes labor-related sentiment on Reddit to understand public opinion on unionization, strike actions, and gig economy reform in order to inform and refine orgnizing efforts. The project combines traditional and modern NLP methods with a novel deep semantic clustering model.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Identify sentiment trends and latent ideological themes in Reddit discourse around labor and unions.
- **Data**: 14,000+ Reddit posts and comments from subreddits like r/antiwork, r/WorkersRights, and r/IATSE.
- **Methods**: Naive Bayes, fine-tuned RoBERTa sentiment classifier, and a custom Deep Contrastive Semantic Clustering (DCSC) model.
- **Key Insight**: Widespread support for union efforts and strike actions, with sharp polarization around gig labor and public-sector unions.

# 🧠 Union Sentiment Analysis on Reddit — NLP Capstone

This repository presents my capstone project for the CUNY M.S. in Data Science program, which analyzes labor-related sentiment on Reddit to understand public opinion on unionization, strike actions, and gig economy reform. The project combines traditional and modern NLP methods with a novel deep semantic clustering model.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Identify sentiment trends and latent ideological themes in Reddit discourse around labor and unions.
- **Data**: 14,000+ Reddit posts and comments from subreddits like r/antiwork, r/WorkersRights, and r/IATSE.
- **Methods**: Naive Bayes, fine-tuned RoBERTa sentiment classifier, and a custom Deep Contrastive Semantic Clustering (DCSC) model.
- **Key Insight**: Widespread support for union efforts and strike actions, with sharp polarization around gig labor and public-sector unions.
